**Data**

The user can select specific improvement percentages per flight phase.

Each flight phase presents indications of potential improvement percentages for different operational concepts.

The operational improvements are only applied to the available trajectory segments in the selected zone/area.

E.g. taxi operational improvements will not affect upper area airspace emissions.
