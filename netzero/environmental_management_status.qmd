*ANSP*​

Several Environmental Systems may be applied at ANSP level, such as EMAS,GreenATM, ISO 14000 family, etc.​

The CANSO GreenATM programme is a voluntary environmental accreditationdesigned for ANSPs to assess and enhance their environmental performance. Itoffers a structured framework with five maturity levels, evaluating areas such asgovernance, operational efficiency, infrastructure, and stakeholder engagement.​

Participation in the GreenATM programme is entirely voluntary for ANSPs. It serves as an independent, industry-endorsed accreditation of their environmental efforts.​

*Airports*

The Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) programme, developed by Airports Council International (ACI), is a globally recognized certification that helps airports measure, manage, and reduce their carbon emissions. It offers a six-level framework, from mapping emissions to achieving net zero, and is based on independent assessment and annual verification.
